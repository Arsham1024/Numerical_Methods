# Numerical Methods
##### I developed these algorithms to find approximate the value of the root(s) of a function: 1. Bisection 2. False-Position 3. Secant 4. Modified-Secant 5. Newton

This was done for CS 3010 Numerical Methods

### Description:
###### All of these methods are used to approximate the value of a root of a function, These are all itterative methods that can converge to a specific root or diverge if the inital value is not chosen correctly. There is an accompanying write up doc for more explanation.
---
### Specifications:
###### These methods are very similar to each other with minor difference. 
###### Both methods will run 50 times maximum.
###### There are 2 functions to solve.

### Functions:
#### Function 1: 
###### f(X) = 2X<sup>3</sup> – 11.7X<sup>2</sup> + 17.7x – 5

#### Function 2: 
###### f(X) = X + 10 – Xcosh(50/X)
