In this folder there are 6 file. Each one corresponds to one method of finding the root.

I have set up the main method to collect all the information from each class and test it with output to the console. so to test the code
simply compile and run. In main there are different methods that test each of these methods. to see the intial input values look into the 
corresponding test method on the bottom.

Please read the comments as they help point out what each function call is doing and separate lines of code that look similar.
